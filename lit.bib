 abstract = {Problems involving causal inference have dogged at the heels of statistics since its earliest days. Correlation does not imply causation, and yet causal conclusions drawn from a carefully designed experiment are often valid. What can a statistical model say about causation? This question is addressed by using a particular model for causal inference (Holland and Rubin 1983; Rubin 1974) to critique the discussions of other writers on causation and causal inference. These include selected philosophers, medical researchers, statisticians, econometricians, and proponents of causal modeling.},

    abstract = { The bootstrap (Efron (1979a)) is conceptually the simplest of all the techniques considered here. We begin our discussion with the bootstrap estimate of standard deviation, which performed well in Tables 3.1–3.3, and then go on to more general problems. The connection with the jackknife is made in Chapter 6. }
