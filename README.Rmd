## The Bootstrap for Causal Inference

@Imbens_2021 provide a bootstrap procedure for inference on causal parameters. Unlike the classical bootstrap, this also accounts for design uncertainty, that is uncertainty stemming from the stochastic nature of the treatment assignment. 

In this short paper, I present the procedure proposed by @Imbens_2021 and apply it to experimental data by @Bursztyn_2017.
