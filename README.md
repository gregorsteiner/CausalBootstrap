## The Bootstrap for Causal Inference

Imbens and Menzel (2021) provide a bootstrap procedure for inference on
causal parameters. Unlike the classical bootstrap, this also accounts
for design uncertainty, that is uncertainty stemming from the stochastic
nature of the treatment assignment.

In this short paper, I present the procedure proposed by Imbens and
Menzel (2021) and apply it to experimental data by Bursztyn, Fujiwara,
and Pallais (2017).
